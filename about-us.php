                            <h5 class="text-secondary">The Unavoidable Problem</h5>
                            <p>Life in most densely populated city in the world Dhaka, is hectic and busy. Transportation is both expensive and time consuming. In a city where your average movement speed is 5KM per hour, Millions of hours are wasted in the traffic on a daily basis. Everyday more than 100,000 diagnostic tests are done in Dhaka alone, which means 100,000 people needs make their trip to diagnostic centers and hospitals twice, 1st to drop their blood sample or x-ray or MRI or any other tests. 2nd to collect the reports from lab premises. Moreover, you must stand in the long queue to get your report. The 1st trip is unavoidable, since you have to be physically present for most health checkups, however it is not at all necessary for the 2nd trip. On top of these, there is a risk of coming into the contact of any kind of infectious diseases such as COVID-19. </p>
                            <p>The same problem is applicable for medicine as well.</p>
                            <p>Another big problem in Bangladesh, like most third world country is, digitization of health records. If you somehow can’t find your health records, it is near to impossible to find copies anywhere online.</p>
